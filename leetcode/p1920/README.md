# Build Array from Permutation

This is problem #1920 found at https://leetcode.com/contest/weekly-contest-248/problems/build-array-from-permutation/

## Statement

Given a zero-based permutation `nums` (0-indexed), build an array `ans` of the same length where `ans[i] = nums[nums[i]]` for each `0 <= i < nums.length` and return it.

A zero-based permutation nums is an array of distinct integers from `0` to `nums.length - 1` (inclusive).
